ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This game is about and goes according with "Dungeons and Dragons" is a tabletop roleplaying
game that served as inspiration for this game. In the original game, each session is unique from
the next based on the dungeon master's invented plot and how the players respond to it. But typically,
the game involves a group of players navigating a dungeon by slaying monsters, working out puzzles, and
interacting with other players. Also this game is fundamental framework will serve as an inspiration for our game.
For their own pleasure, an evil sorcerer has kidnapped a bunch of gamers and imprisoned them in a monster-filled,
maze-like dungeon. To escape the dungeon with the most party members still alive is the object of the game.
The dungeon features threats like creatures and traps and makes you hungry (reduces fullness) with each round. 
You can engage in combat, dialogue with NPCs, and exploration, but you must progress through the dungeon before the Sorcerer
loses patience and burns the player and the whole party to death!
